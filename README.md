========================

To contact the developers of CoMD send email to exmatex-comd@llnl.gov.

CoMD is a reference implementation of typical classical molecular
dynamics algorithms and workloads.  It is created and maintained by
The Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments
(ExMatEx).  http://codesign.lanl.gov/projects/exmatex.  The
code is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing
others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of 
new architectures, programming models, etc.
