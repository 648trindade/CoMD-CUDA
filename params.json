{"name":"Comd","tagline":"Classical molecular dynamics proxy application.","body":"## CoMD version 1.1\r\n\r\nCoMD is a reference implementation of typical classical molecular\r\ndynamics algorithms and workloads.  It is created and maintained by\r\nThe Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments\r\n(ExMatEx).  http://codesign.lanl.gov/projects/exmatex.  The\r\ncode is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing\r\nothers to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of \r\nnew architectures, programming models, etc.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n#### MPI\r\n\r\n#### Serial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCoMD 1.1 was developed by David Richards (@richards12), Jamal (@pjhyett), and Sue (@mojombo). Additional developers of CoMD 1.0 were Sriram.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with CoMD?
